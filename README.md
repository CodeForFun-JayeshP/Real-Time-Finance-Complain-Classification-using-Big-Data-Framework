Complaints can give us insights into problems people are experiencing in the marketplace and help us to understand the reason and do necessary modifications in existing financial products if required. Each week the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sends thousands of consumer complaints about financial products and services to company for a response. Classify those consumer complaints into the product category they belongs to using the description of the complaint. The goal of this project is to classify the complaint into a specific product category. Since it has multiple categories, it becomes a multiclass classification that can be solved through many machine learning algorithms. Once the algorithm is in place, whenever there is a new complaint, we can easily categorize it and can then be redirected to the concerned person. This will save a lot of time because we are minimizing the human interventions to decide whom this complaint should go to.
